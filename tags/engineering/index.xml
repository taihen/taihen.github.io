I thought
&amp;ldquo;professional&amp;rdquo; meant universal and that technical rigor transcended culture. I
was not just incorrect, &lt;strong&gt;I was naively wrong&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent about twenty-five years working in infrastructure engineering, almost
always in multinational distributed teams. I&amp;rsquo;ve been the formal manager of an
infrastructure team twice in my career, but mostly I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the other side,
a team member trying to figure out how to work with people who think,
communicate, and collaborate completely differently than I do. Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m in
a team of seven people where every single person has a different nationality,
trying to help, enable and influence while &amp;ldquo;my way&amp;rdquo; might not be &amp;ldquo;their way.&amp;rdquo; I
misjudge people&amp;rsquo;s preferences regularly and have to repair trust after the fact.
It&amp;rsquo;s uncomfortable every time, but it&amp;rsquo;s part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Almost Right - but Wrong</title><link>https://taihen.org/posts/almost-right-but-wrong/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 21:55:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://taihen.org/posts/almost-right-but-wrong/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I care deeply about is &lt;strong&gt;helping other engineers grow&lt;/strong&gt;. Over the last year, I’ve had a lot of conversations, some with folks just entering the field, others with seasoned pros, asking the same question: &lt;strong&gt;how is AI going to reshape our work?&lt;/strong&gt; There is fear and uncertainty, but also some optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="theres-a-rhythm-to-these-tech-cycles"&gt;There’s a rhythm to these tech cycles.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen it before, big promises, huge hype, sweeping predictions. Right now, we’re being told that &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2025/04/25/the-jobs-that-will-fall-first-as-ai-takes-over-the-workplace/"&gt;AI will replace&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/108792-openai-ceo-sam-altman-warns-ai-could-wipe.html"&gt;entire roles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/ai-will-replace-recruiters-and-assistants-in-six-months-says-ceo-behind-chatgpt-rival-2000631871"&gt;maybe entire industries&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the same energy &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/millions-professional-drivers-will-be-replaced-self-driving-vehicles-n817356"&gt;we saw&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/how-ubers-autonomous-cars-will-destroy-10-million-jobs-and-reshape-the-economy-by-2025-lyft-google-zack-kanter/"&gt;self-driving cars&lt;/a&gt;. For years, we were told they were just around the corner. But today, in 2025, I still don’t see a 40-ton truck rolling down the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobahn"&gt;Autobahn&lt;/a&gt; without a driver. Waymo works, yes, but in tightly controlled areas, in a few cities. Meanwhile, here in Europe, truck drivers are still &lt;a href="https://www.iru.org/news-resources/newsroom/half-european-truck-operators-cant-expand-due-driver-shortages"&gt;very much in demand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
