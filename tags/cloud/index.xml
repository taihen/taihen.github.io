The first time I heard the term, &lt;strong>I pictured a container floating off into the void - no OS, no shell, just… code&lt;/strong>. Turns out, that’s not too far from the truth, but just like Serverless, Distroless is a misleading term!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s break down what distroless containers are, why you might want them in your stack, what they’re great at (and not-so-great at), plus how to actually debug one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Evolution of Configuration Management</title><link>https://taihen.org/posts/configuration_management/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 21:45:01 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://taihen.org/posts/configuration_management/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over my two decades as an infrastructure engineer, I&amp;rsquo;ve watched our field transform dramatically. What began with manual server configuration has evolved into defining entire organizations infrastructure as code. This journey reflects not just technological change, but a complete shift in how we approach managing systems at scale. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the trenches through most of it, and I want to share my story of this evolution with fellow infrastructure engineers who&amp;rsquo;ve lived through similar transitions.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
