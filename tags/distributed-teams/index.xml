I thought
&amp;ldquo;professional&amp;rdquo; meant universal and that technical rigor transcended culture. I
was not just incorrect, &lt;strong&gt;I was naively wrong&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent about twenty-five years working in infrastructure engineering, almost
always in multinational distributed teams. I&amp;rsquo;ve been the formal manager of an
infrastructure team twice in my career, but mostly I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the other side,
a team member trying to figure out how to work with people who think,
communicate, and collaborate completely differently than I do. Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m in
a team of seven people where every single person has a different nationality,
trying to help, enable and influence while &amp;ldquo;my way&amp;rdquo; might not be &amp;ldquo;their way.&amp;rdquo; I
misjudge people&amp;rsquo;s preferences regularly and have to repair trust after the fact.
It&amp;rsquo;s uncomfortable every time, but it&amp;rsquo;s part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
