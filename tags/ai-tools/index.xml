I got into programming because I loved the exploration, making mistakes, finding solutions and moving slowly bit by bit. One day I needed system tool then I wrote some C, the other time I needed some glue code, so I got comfortable with Perl or Bash. Needed to created website? Well&amp;hellip; PHP was the languge for it - basically whatever was up to the job. I never learned any of these to the level of a professional, was never interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed solving puzzles, one at the time, it was creative freeform craft. It was messy, it was dounting. It was fun, sooo much fun!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I spend my days writing prose about code instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kentbeck.com/"&gt;Kent Beck&lt;/a&gt; calls AI code agents the genie in the bottle: &lt;strong&gt;you get what you wish for, not what you want&lt;/strong&gt;. He&amp;rsquo;s right, but in ways I did not expected.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
