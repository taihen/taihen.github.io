This project was directly inspired by the outstanding work of &lt;a href="https://www.grc.com/dns/benchmark.htm">Steve Gibson&lt;/a> and his well-known DNS Benchmark utility. Steve’s meticulous attention to detail in benchmarking DNS performance motivated me to create something similar, but tailored specifically for the command line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This CLI tool, written in Go, allows individual users to quickly test and compare various recursive DNS servers, checking key metrics such as latency, reliability, DNSSEC validation, and even response correctness—like detecting servers that hijack NXDOMAIN responses.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
