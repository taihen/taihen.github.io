What began with manual server configuration has evolved into defining entire organizations infrastructure as code. This journey reflects not just technological change, but a complete shift in how we approach managing systems at scale. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the trenches through most of it, and I want to share my story of this evolution with fellow infrastructure engineers who&amp;rsquo;ve lived through similar transitions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>January 1, 1970</title><link>https://taihen.org/posts/1970/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2007 22:36:36 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://taihen.org/posts/1970/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;On the day of my birthday, I wondered (of course - as many us do), if this is my start date, what is the to origin story of the birth date of computer time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Unix epoch, defined as 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970, serves as the foundational reference point for timekeeping in nearly all modern computing systems. This date, though seemingly arbitrary, emerged from a confluence of technical constraints, historical decisions, and practical considerations during Unix&amp;rsquo;s early development.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
