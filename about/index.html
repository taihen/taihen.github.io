Throughout this evolution, I&rsquo;ve maintained a philosophy that effective infrastructure should be invisible to end users while providing rock-solid reliability for the applications it supports.</p><p>Each technology wave ‚Äì from the manual configuration era to the infrastructure-as-code revolution ‚Äì has reinforced my belief that understanding fundamentals matters more than chasing trends. That&rsquo;s why I remain, at heart, a Linux enthusiast who appreciates elegant solutions built on solid engineering principles.</p><h2 id=what-do-i-do>What Do I Do?</h2><ul><li><strong>System Engineering:</strong> tools for performance, automation and experience.</li><li><strong>Infrastructure Engineering:</strong> building and maintaining infrastructure solutions, both on-premises and in the cloud.</li><li><strong>Tech Outreach:</strong> sharing insights, tutorials, and experiences.</li></ul><p>Although my background is in robotics and C, I‚Äôve spent most of my career in the Telco world. I‚Äôve had the privilege of speaking at events about global routing security, IPv6, and DNSSEC ‚Äî topics that really make my heart race (in a good way)!</p><h2 id=engineering-principles>Engineering Principles</h2><p>My approach to infrastructure engineering is guided by core beliefs:</p><ul><li><strong>Reliability Before Features:</strong> A system that works consistently beats one with flashy capabilities that fail unpredictably.</li><li><strong>Automation as Documentation:</strong> Well-crafted automation serves dual purposes ‚Äì it both executes and documents the expected system state.</li><li><strong>Observability by Design:</strong> Systems should be designed from the ground up to be monitored, measured, and understood.</li><li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Today&rsquo;s elegant solution will be tomorrow&rsquo;s technical debt if not regularly refined.</li></ul><h2 id=beyond-the-terminal>Beyond the Terminal</h2><p>The discipline and strategic thinking I developed as a basketball player directly translates to how I approach complex engineering challenges. Just as a successful fast break requires anticipating multiple moving parts, building resilient infrastructure demands thinking several steps ahead.</p><p>My current passion for distance running and collecting Superhalfs medals üèÖ across Europe reflects my approach to engineering problems ‚Äì steady progress, consistent effort, and the satisfaction of reaching meaningful milestones through persistence.</p><h2 id=get-in-touch>Get In Touch</h2><p>Feel free to <a href=/contact/>reach out</a> if you have any questions, feedback, or just want to connect.</p><p>I&rsquo;m particularly interested in discussing:</p><ul><li>Infrastructure scalability challenges in high-throughput environments</li><li>Mentoring opportunities for early-career infrastructure engineers</li><li>Speaking engagements related to network security or infrastructure automation</li><li>Collaboration on open-source tools for infrastructure management</li></ul></div></article></div></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://taihen.org/>&copy; taihen.org / 418 ... engineering in progress 2025</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
