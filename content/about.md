## Who Am I?

I'm a staff level infrastructure engineer with a love for creating innovative solutions and exploring new technologies. My tech journey started back when you needed to be a gym member just to lift those servers! 💪

I’ve seen it all (well, almost): from servers under you desk, the wild west days of configuration management, through the cloud’s grand entrance, survived the epic container orchestrator wars (who remembers [Tupperware?](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/aravindnarayanan-facebook140613153626phpapp02-37588997/37588997)), and now I’m all aboard the Kubernetes train. Deep down though, I’m just a Linux guy.

## What Do I Do?

- **System Engineering:** Building system engineering tools for performance, automation and experience.
- **Infrastructure Engineering:** Developing scalable infrastructure solutions.
- **Tech Outreach:** Sharing insights, tutorials, and experiences.

Although my background is in robotics and C, I’ve spent most of my career in the Telco world, where I did lots of bash and pearl. I’ve had the privilege of speaking at events about global routing security, IPv6, and DNSSEC — topics that really make my heart race (in a good way)!

When I’m not tinkering with tech - I used to play semi-professional basketball 🏀. But after too many rolled ankles and hurt knees 🤕, I’ve traded the court for the open road. Nowadays, I just run—for fun and to stay fit. 🏃‍♂️ I’m currently on a mission to collect all the [Superhalfs](https://www.superhalfs.com/en/) medals 🏅 (half marathons across Europe).

## My Mission

To inspire and empower others through technology. I believe in the power of collaboration and code to change the world. I'm dedicated to making a positive impact through my work.

## Get In Touch

Feel free to [reach out]({{< relref "/contact/" >}}) if you have any questions, feedback, or just want to connect. I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
