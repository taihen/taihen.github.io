## Who Am I?

I'm a staff level infrastructure engineer with a affection for creating solutions and exploring new technologies.

![Me](/images/me.jpg)

TL;DR I build systems for others.

## This site

This is a collection of posts that I've written across the years. Most are gone, but some were worth to keep them.

## The Engineering Journey

From placing servers under desks in the late 90s to designing and building hybrid cloud solutions today, my career has been defined by solving increasingly complex infrastructure challenges.

What started with a foundation in robotics and C programming evolved when I discovered my passion for infrastructure in the telecommunications sector. Throughout this evolution, I've maintained a philosophy that effective infrastructure should be invisible to end users while providing rock-solid reliability for the applications it supports.

Each technology wave – from the manual configuration era to the infrastructure-as-code revolution – has reinforced my belief that understanding fundamentals matters more than chasing trends. That's why I remain, at heart, a Linux enthusiast who appreciates elegant solutions built on solid engineering principles.

## What Do I Do?

- **System Engineering:** tools for performance, automation and experience.
- **Infrastructure Engineering:** building and maintaining infrastructure solutions, both on-premises and in the cloud.
- **Tech Outreach:** sharing insights, tutorials, and experiences.

I've had the privilege of speaking at events about global routing security, IPv6, and DNSSEC — topics that really make my heart race (in a good way)!

## Engineering Principles

My approach to infrastructure engineering is guided by core beliefs:

- **Reliability Before Features:** A system that works consistently beats one with flashy capabilities that fail unpredictably.
- **Automation as Documentation:** Well-crafted automation serves dual purposes – it both executes and documents the expected system state.
- **Observability by Design:** Systems should be designed from the ground up to be monitored, measured, and understood.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Today's elegant solution will be tomorrow's technical debt if not regularly refined.

## Beyond the Terminal

The discipline and strategic thinking I developed as a basketball player directly translates to how I approach complex engineering challenges. Just as a successful fast break requires anticipating multiple moving parts, building resilient infrastructure demands thinking several steps ahead.

My current passion for distance running and collecting Superhalfs medals 🏅 across Europe reflects my approach to engineering problems – steady progress, consistent effort, and the satisfaction of reaching meaningful milestones through persistence.

## Get In Touch

Feel free to [reach out]({{< relref "/contact/" >}}) if you have any questions, feedback, or just want to connect.

I'm particularly interested in discussing:

- Infrastructure scalability challenges in high-throughput environments
- Mentoring opportunities for early-career infrastructure engineers
- Speaking engagements related to network security or infrastructure automation
