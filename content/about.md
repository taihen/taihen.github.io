## Who Am I?

I'm a staff level infrastructure engineer with a love for creating innovative solutions and exploring new technologies.

I’ve seen it all (well, almost): from servers under you desk, the wild west days of configuration management, through the cloud’s grand entrance, survived the container orchestrator wars (who remembers [Tupperware?](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/aravindnarayanan-facebook140613153626phpapp02-37588997/37588997)), and now I’m all aboard the Kubernetes train. But deep down though, I’m just a Linux guy.

## What Do I Do?

- **System Engineering:** Building system engineering tools for performance, automation and experience.
- **Infrastructure Engineering:** Developing scalable infrastructure solutions.
- **Tech Outreach:** Sharing insights, tutorials, and experiences.

I’ve spent most of my career in the Telco world, first as a entrapanur and engineer, later trainer and evangelist. I’ve had the privilege of speaking at events about global routing security, IPv6, and DNSSEC — topics that really make my heart race (in a good way)!
