### The 2,487-Day Flex

In the early 2000s, sysadmins wore server uptimes like badges of honor. I once met a colleague who told me about some RHEL 5 box that ran for **2,487 days** without a reboot.

This wasn’t uncommon. Teams would gather around terminals like campfires:

- "After running uninterrupted for 3737 days, this humble Sun 280R server running Solaris 9 was shut down. At the time of making the video it was idle, the last service it had was removed sometime last year. [A tribute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAUvfqLEWuA) was made with some feelings about Sun, Solaris, the walk to the data center and freeing a machine from internet-slavery."

The logic? *“If it ain’t broke, don’t touch it.”* Never mind that “it” was a security liability running kernel versions older than the interns. 

But, lets keep in mind, those were different times.

### Different times?

Back in the 90s and early 2000s, rebooting server or network equipment was often seen as a last resort rather than a routine maintenance step. The constrains where quite different. Security landscape of those times was quite different and we had different relations with the machines that we've worked on. Most we have had installed ourself, most had name, some had personalities.

#### Downtime Concerns

Rebooting meant taking critical systems offline, which could disrupt services and affect users or business operations. High uptime was a point of pride, so any forced interruption was avoided if possible. High availability tooling ( proxies, load balancers) was in its inception so most applications where running on a single server, resulting reboots meant then always downtime. This is physical machine being rebooted and boot took many minutes ... at best.

#### Risk of Boot Issues

Older hardware and software weren’t always as robust as today’s. As reboots where avoided, problems were unavoidable. A reboot could sometimes lead to unpredictable problems during startup—like configuration glitches, file corruptions or hardware initialization failures - that might require manual, on-site intervention. If a server has a two year uptime in busy environment, if power cycled, will it come back?

#### Limited Remote Management

Remote monitoring and management tools were not as advanced. If something went wrong after a reboot, administrators might have had to physically visit the data center to fix the issue. Most of the racks did not have remotely controlled KVMs, usually sysadmins have had trolleys with screens and keyboards available on each data center floor.

#### Stability Philosophy

There was a strong “if it isn’t broken, don’t fix it” culture. Administrators preferred to let systems run continuously rather than risk introducing new problems with a reboot.

#### Lack of Hot Patching

Unlike today’s systems that support live patching and updates, older systems often needed a full reboot to apply fixes or updates, which meant scheduled maintenance windows were rare and meticulously planned.

In summary, the potential for downtime, unpredictable behavior during boot, and the lack of sophisticated remote management tools made administrators very cautious about rebooting their gear back then.

## Modern Wisdom: Uptime ≠ Excellence

Today, high uptime raises eyebrows, not applause. Tools like Ansible and Puppet prioritize *security* and *consistency* over raw longevity.

Yet, part of me misses the audacity of those early days. There’s something undeniably poetic about a server outlasting *multiple iPhone generations* on sheer grit. Just don’t tell security.
