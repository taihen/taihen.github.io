As infrastructure engineers, we often find ourselves bridging gaps between the tools we use and the monitoring systems we rely on. When I've migrated to **Prometheus** and **Grafana** on one of the sites, integrating [**Accel-PPP**](https://github.com/accel-ppp/accel-ppp) posed a unique challenge. The absence of native **Prometheus** support for **Accel-PPP** meant I was stuck with an SNMP-based monitoring setup, but relying on SNMP for metrics felt like patching a modern system with legacy tools—inefficient and less than ideal. This led me to develop [**accel-exporter**](https://github.com/taihen/accel-exporter), a straightforward solution to seamlessly connect **Accel-PPP** with **Prometheus**.

### What does accel-exporter Do?

**accel-exporter** is a lightweight Go application designed to:

- Extract Metrics: It interfaces with Accel-PPP’s accel-cmd utility to gather statistics.
- Expose for Prometheus: The extracted data is formatted and served over an HTTP endpoint (/metrics), ready for Prometheus to scrape.
- Simplify Integration: With minimal configuration, it fits seamlessly into existing Prometheus and Grafana setups, providing clear and actionable insights into BRAS performance.

### Getting Started

Deploying **accel-exporter** is straightforward:

- Download the Binary: Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/taihen/accel-exporter/releases) from the GitHub repository.
- Set Permissions: Ensure it has the necessary permissions to execute accel-cmd.
- Run the Exporter: Launch it with your preferred settings. For example:

```bash
./accel-exporter --accel-cmd-path=/usr/bin/accel-cmd --web.listen-address=:9101
```

- Configure Prometheus: Add the exporter’s endpoint to your Prometheus configuration to start collecting metrics.

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'accel-ppp'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9101']
```

- Visualize with Grafana: Use Grafana to create dashboards and visualize the collected data. To simplify that process, I've also added a [dashboard](https://github.com/taihen/accel-exporter/blob/main/dashboards/) to the repository as a easy start.

For those managing Accel-PPP and seeking a simple - ready to use solution, **accel-exporter** offers a straightforward path to integrate with Prometheus and Grafana, enhancing observability without the SNMP overhead.
