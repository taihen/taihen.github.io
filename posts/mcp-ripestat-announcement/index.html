We&rsquo;ll use the Facebook global outage from October 4, 2021 - the day Facebook accidentally withdrew all their BGP routes and took down not just Facebook, but Instagram, WhatsApp, and even their internal systems.</p><h3 id=the-incident-what-actually-happened>The Incident: What Actually Happened</h3><p>On October 4, 2021, Facebook&rsquo;s engineering team was performing routine maintenance on their backbone routers. A command intended to assess available capacity accidentally took down all the connections in their backbone network, withdrawing all Facebook routes from the global Internet.</p><p><strong>The Traditional Investigation Approach:</strong></p><p>When Facebook went dark, network engineers worldwide would have:</p><ol><li>Checked their own routing tables manually</li><li>Visited multiple BGP looking glasses</li><li>Cross-referenced data from different RIRs</li><li>Manually correlated routing announcements</li><li>Spent lots of time piecing together the timeline</li></ol><p><strong>The MCP RIPEstat Approach:</strong></p><p>Let&rsquo;s reconstruct what this analysis would look like with natural language queries:</p><h3 id=step-1-initial-assessment>Step 1: Initial Assessment</h3><pre tabindex=0><code>&gt; &#34;What can you tell me about Facebook&#39;s main AS?&#34;

Facebook (AS32934) is a major Internet presence with extensive global infrastructure.

Analyzing 31.13.64.0/18 (Facebook&#39;s core infrastructure block):
- Oct 1-4: Stable visibility ~340-342 full BGP peers
- Oct 4 16:00 UTC onwards: Maintained visibility
- Oct 5-6: Returned to normal ~340 peers
- Minor fluctuations typical of normal routing dynamics
</code></pre><p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This instantly shows you the incident timeline. The routing data reveals that while there were some fluctuations around October 4-5, 2021, the specific /24 we queried maintained relatively stable visibility - but this is looking at aggregate data. During the actual outage, more specific prefixes would have shown complete withdrawal.</p><h3 id=step-3-multi-prefix-correlation-analysis>Step 3: Multi-Prefix Correlation Analysis</h3><pre tabindex=0><code>&gt; &#34;Compare routing stability for Facebook&#39;s edge networks vs core infrastructure&#34;

Core Infrastructure (31.13.64.0/18):
- Maintained consistent BGP visibility throughout analysis period
- 340+ peer visibility indicates tier-1 connectivity

Edge Networks Analysis Needed:
- Would require checking multiple /24s within the larger block
- More specific prefixes likely showed the actual withdrawal pattern

- Direct peering at major IXPs worldwide
- Complex mesh of provider and peer relationships

Analyzing Facebook&#39;s 157.240.0.0/16 infrastructure block during the October 4, 2021 outage:

🚨 CRITICAL ROUTING ANOMALIES DETECTED:

157.240.207.0/24 (AS32934) - MAJOR WITHDRAWAL EVENT:
• Oct 3-4 15:59 UTC: Normal visibility (341 full peers)
• Oct 4 16:00-23:59 UTC: Catastrophic drop to 23 peers (-93% visibility)
• Oct 5 00:00+ UTC: Full recovery (341 peers restored)

157.240.159.0/24 (AS63293) - SUSTAINED DEGRADATION:
• Oct 3-4 07:59 UTC: Normal visibility (342 full peers)
• Oct 4 08:00 - Oct 5 07:59 UTC: Reduced to 219 peers (-36% visibility)
• Oct 5 08:00+ UTC: Recovery to 341 peers

TIMELINE ANALYSIS:
The data shows clear evidence of Facebook&#39;s BGP withdrawal starting Oct 4 around 16:00 UTC (11am PST) - exactly when their maintenance began. The 157.240.207.0/24 prefix experienced near-complete global invisibility, dropping from 341 to just 23 BGP peers, indicating widespread route withdrawal across major Internet exchanges.

This confirms the incident timeline reported in Facebook&#39;s post-mortem.
</code></pre><p><strong>Cross-validation becomes trivial:</strong></p><pre tabindex=0><code>&gt; &#34;Compare Facebook&#39;s routing announcements with their main competitors during the same timeframe - did anyone else experience similar issues?&#34;

Comparative BGP Analysis Oct 3-5, 2021:

Facebook Infrastructure (AS32934):
- Significant routing disruptions on Oct 4 16:00-23:59 UTC
- Multiple prefixes showed dramatic visibility drops
- Pattern indicates coordinated withdrawal, not random failures

Other Major Content Networks:
- Google (AS15169): Maintained stable routing throughout period
- Cloudflare (AS13335): No visibility anomalies detected
- Amazon (AS16509): Normal routing patterns observed

CONCLUSION: The Oct 4 routing issues were isolated to Facebook&#39;s network infrastructure - this was an internal configuration problem, not a broader Internet stability issue.
</code></pre><p><strong>Impact assessment becomes instant:</strong></p><pre tabindex=0><code>&gt; &#34;Which networks typically use Facebook as a transit provider, and how would they have been affected by a complete BGP withdrawal?&#34;

Facebook Transit Impact Assessment:

Direct Impact:
- Facebook operates as origin AS (32934) primarily, not transit provider
- Limited downstream customer impact compared to tier-1 carriers
- Primary impact: Loss of access TO Facebook services, not THROUGH Facebook

Affected Services:
- Facebook.com, Instagram, WhatsApp applications
- Facebook&#39;s CDN edge networks (multiple ASNs: 63293, 35819, 33667, etc.)
- Third-party sites using Facebook Connect/OAuth

Network Engineering Impact:
- NOCs worldwide spent resources investigating &#34;their&#34; routing issues
- Increased support tickets from users reporting connectivity problems
- Unnecessary troubleshooting of local infrastructure

The real impact was service availability, not transit routing - Facebook&#39;s customers couldn&#39;t reach Facebook, rather than Facebook disrupting other networks&#39; connectivity.
