My first taste of &ldquo;automation&rdquo; came with <a href=https://github.com/duncs/clusterssh>ClusterSSH</a> - a basic tool that let me run commands on multiple SSH sessions at once.</p><p>The concept was dead simple: I&rsquo;d open an administration console and multiple terminal windows to my servers. Whatever I typed in the admin console would be copied to all connected servers. No versioning, no rollback capability, and a single typo could bring down your entire environment. But compared to connecting to each server individually, this felt like magic.</p><h3 id=cfengine-the-first-real-configuration-management>CFEngine: The First Real Configuration Management</h3><p>As server fleets grew beyond what ClusterSSH could handle, I discovered <a href=https://cfengine.com/>CFEngine</a> - one of the pioneers of true configuration management. Created in 1993 by <a href=https://markburgess.org/bio.html>Mark Burgess</a>, CFEngine introduced something revolutionary: describing the desired state of your systems instead of writing step-by-step scripts.</p><p>With CFEngine, I could specify that a particular configuration file should exist with specific content and permissions, and CFEngine would make it happen regardless of the starting state. This approach addressed a growing problem - shell scripts were becoming unmanageable jumbles of conditionals to handle different OS quirks.</p><p>The learning curve was steep (CFEngine had its own DSL that felt alien), but it solved real problems of consistency. As noted in <a href=https://www.atlassian.com/microservices/microservices-architecture/configuration-management>&ldquo;Configuration Management: Definition and Benefits&rdquo;</a> by Atlassian, this type of systems engineering process established consistency throughout a service life.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#75715e># filepath: /path/to/cfengine_example.cf</span>

I&rsquo;d define resources - packages to install, files to manage, services to run - and Puppet would figure out how to make it happen. The master-agent architecture meant I had a central server that stored configurations and pushed them out to agents on each node.</p><p>Chef took a different approach, using Ruby for its configurations instead of DSL. While this made Chef more powerful for complex scenarios (you had the full power of a programming language), it also meant a steeper learning curve. I found Chef valuable for complex deployments, but many team members not only often struggled with its Ruby-based approach.</p><p>Both tools significantly improved how I managed infrastructure, but they shared common challenges: complex setup, agent management headaches, and certificate overhead. Theoretically could almost arbitrary number of servers, although at early stages, both struggle with large fleets of servers due to master-agent architecture. Both had default implementations that could only reliably manage a limited number of nodes, requiring architectural modifications and performance optimizations to scale effectively. Running large infrastructures with either tool needed to implement load balancing, distributed architectures, and careful resource management to overcome these limitations - which made most of the implementations complicated.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-puppet data-lang=puppet><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#75715e># filepath: /path/to/puppet_example.pp</span><span style=color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010>

Salt used YAML files called &ldquo;states&rdquo; to define configurations and ZeroMQ for communications between the master and minions (agents).</p><p>What I loved about Salt was its event-driven nature. Rather than just periodically applying configurations, Salt could react to events in real-time. When a new server came online, it would automatically get the right configuration without manual intervention.</p><p>For bare metal environments, I combined Salt with PXE boot servers and kickstart files to automate the entire provisioning process. A new physical server would boot via PXE, get its OS installed, then register with the Salt master and receive its configuration. This approach let me take a server from bare metal to production-ready with zero manual steps.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-yaml data-lang=yaml><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#75715e># filepath: /path/to/salt_example.sls</span>

Yet again, I&rsquo;ve encountered challenges when scaling to very large environments with thousands of devices. The sequential execution model of Ansible could become a bottleneck, and complex workflows sometimes required more programming flexibility than YAML provides.</p><p>This led me to explore complementary tools that address these specific scaling challenges.</p><h3 id=nornir-python-powered-network-automation>Nornir: Python-Powered Network Automation</h3><p>One tool that&rsquo;s been a game-changer for large-scale network automation is <a href=https://nornir.readthedocs.io/>Nornir</a>. Unlike Ansible, which uses YAML playbooks, Nornir is 100% Python. This means I can leverage the full power of Python for complex network automation tasks.</p><p>What makes Nornir particularly valuable for scaling is its parallel execution capability. Nornir can execute jobs in parallel across hundreds or thousands of devices, dramatically reducing the time required for network-wide changes. This makes it ideal for large-scale networks where sequential task execution would be prohibitively slow.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve found that Nornir complements Ansible rather than replacing it. I used Ansible for most day-to-day network automation tasks and switch to Nornir when I need the scalability of parallel execution or when I need more complex logic than YAML can easily express.</p><h3 id=a-holistic-approach-to-network-automation>A Holistic Approach to Network Automation</h3><p>Through my experience, I&rsquo;ve realized that scaling network automation requires more than just good tools—it requires a holistic approach that integrates network automation with other IT systems and processes.</p><p>Many organizations struggled with scaling network automation because they focus on automating specific tasks on specific devices without considering the broader workflow. This piecemeal approach inevitably hits a wall when you need to orchestrate changes across different network domains and integrate with IT service management systems.</p><p>The key insight is that truly scalable network automation requires end-to-end orchestration across multiple network domains and IT systems. Tools like <a href=https://www.itential.com/>Itential</a> have emerged to address this need, enabling teams to build automation that address specific use cases and then expand to include integration with IT systems for the entire process from ticket creation to closure.</p><h2 id=the-paradigm-shift-from-configuration-management-to-infrastructure-as-code>The Paradigm Shift: From Configuration Management to Infrastructure as Code</h2><h3 id=the-fundamental-difference>The Fundamental Difference</h3><p>As cloud adoption accelerated in the 2010s, I hit a limitation with traditional configuration management: these tools were designed to configure existing systems, not provision the infrastructure itself.</p><p>This realization marked a key insight: Configuration Management focuses on maintaining the state of existing systems (installing packages, managing services), while Infrastructure as Code (IaC) targets the provisioning and management of the infrastructure resources themselves (VMs, networks, storage). As explained in <a href=https://www.xcubelabs.com/blog/product-engineering-blog/infrastructure-as-code-and-configuration-management/>&ldquo;Infrastructure as Code and Configuration Management&rdquo;</a>, they serve different but complementary purposes.</p><h3 id=terraform-declaring-infrastructure>Terraform: Declaring Infrastructure</h3><p>My introduction to <a href=https://www.terraform.io/>Terraform</a> in 2015 was a pivotal moment. Terraform allowed me to define my entire infrastructure in code using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). This wasn&rsquo;t just about running commands on existing servers - it was about creating the servers themselves through code.</p><p>The power of Terraform&rsquo;s state-based approach became immediately apparent. Terraform tracks the resources it manages, enabling it to calculate precisely what needs to change during updates. This state management gave me unprecedented control over infrastructure changes.</p><p>Even more importantly, codifying infrastructure brought software development practices to infrastructure: version control, peer reviews, automated testing. When a junior engineer proposed a production change, we could review the exact changes in a pull request before anything was deployed.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-hcl data-lang=hcl><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#75715e># filepath: /path/to/terraform_example.tf

This is where specialized bare metal provisioning tools like <a href=https://maas.io/>MAAS (Metal as a Service)</a> come in.</p><p>MAAS, developed by Canonical, treats physical servers like virtual machines in the cloud. It provides a way to manage a large number of physical machines by creating a resource pool. Machines can be provisioned automatically, used as needed, and then released back into the pool when no longer required.</p><p>What makes MAAS powerful is its comprehensive approach: it handles automatic discovery and registration of devices, BMC (IPMI, RedFish) and PXE automation, and integration with configuration management tools like Ansible and Salt.</p><p>The workflow is elegant: when a new server is connected to the network, MAAS discovers it, powers it on via IPMI or RedFish, boots it using PXE, and registers it in the inventory. You can then allocate the server to a specific workload, and MAAS will provision it with the appropriate OS and configuration.</p><h3 id=foreman-complete-lifecycle-management>Foreman: Complete Lifecycle Management</h3><p>Another tool I&rsquo;ve used for bare metal is <a href=https://www.theforeman.org/>Foreman</a>, an open-source lifecycle management tool for physical and virtual servers. It handles provisioning, configuration, and monitoring throughout a server&rsquo;s lifecycle.</p><p>Foreman integrates with multiple provisioning methods and configuration management tools. For bare metal, it uses PXE boot and MAC address identification. You create host entries, specify the MAC address, and provision automatically.</p><p>This integration with tools like Puppet, Chef, Salt, and Ansible allows using a single tool for both provisioning and configuration management - particularly valuable in heterogeneous environments with both physical and virtual machines.</p><h3 id=openstack-ironic-bare-metal-as-a-service>OpenStack Ironic: Bare Metal as a Service</h3><p>For organizations using OpenStack, <a href=https://www.openstack.org/software/releases/victoria/components/ironic>Ironic</a> provides bare metal provisioning capabilities within the OpenStack ecosystem.

The key components include the API service, conductor service, and inspector service, which together provide a complete solution for bare metal management.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve used Ironic in environments already invested in OpenStack.

This isn&rsquo;t theoretical - it&rsquo;s how real infrastructure teams operate daily.</p><p>As explained in <a href=https://configu.com/blog/what-is-configuration-as-code-cac-and-5-tips-for-success/>&ldquo;Configuration-as-Code: Principles and Best Practices&rdquo;</a>, &ldquo;Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is about automating the provisioning of infrastructure&mldr; Configuration-as-Code (CaC) is about managing the settings and parameters that an application or system component needs to function correctly&rdquo;.</p><p>In practice, I use Terraform to provision and manages cloud infrastructure resources - creating VMs, networks, storage, and security groups. While Ansible for all the bare metal infrastructure, whatever servers, storage or network devices.</p><p>This hybrid approach offers several advantages:</p><ol><li>Clean separation of concerns</li><li>Flexibility to use different tools based on their strengths</li><li>Simplified workflows where each tool does what it does best</li></ol><h3 id=why-ansible-remains-relevant-in-the-iac-era>Why Ansible Remains Relevant in the IaC Era</h3><p>Among configuration management tools, Ansible has shown remarkable staying power. Its agentless architecture, simplicity, and flexibility have allowed it to adapt to changing practices.</p><p>The introduction of <a href=https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible>Ansible Automation Platform</a> with features like automation mesh has further enhanced its relevance. Automation mesh enables distributing automation workloads across hybrid environments, making Ansible suitable even for distributed, cloud-native deployments.</p><p>What&rsquo;s particularly exciting is that IBM (which <a href=https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-closes-landmark-acquisition-red-hat-34-billion-defines-open-hybrid-cloud-future>already owns Red Hat</a> and Ansible) <a href=https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/hashicorp-officially-joins-the-ibm-family>recently acquired HashiCorp</a>, the makers of Terraform, for $6.4 billion in 2024. This move shows that even the big players recognize the natural synergy between these tools. I&rsquo;m pretty confident that over time, IBM will bring Terraform and Ansible even closer together as a unified offering. They&rsquo;ve already mentioned how Terraform&rsquo;s infrastructure provisioning capabilities combined with Ansible&rsquo;s configuration management creates a powerful one-two punch for hybrid cloud environments. It&rsquo;s like having the best of both worlds under one roof - and honestly, it makes perfect sense given how many of us already use them together in our daily workflows.</p><p>As a practical example, I use Ansible alongside Terraform for managing some on-prem Kubernetes clusters. Ansible provisions the cluster infrastructure, while Terraform configures the application deployment, and day-2 operations.</p><h3 id=are-we-done-yet>Are we done yet?</h3><p>Far from it!</p><p>Meet <a href=https://www.systeminit.com/>System Initiative</a>, a new tool from Chef founder Adam Jacob released in 2024.
