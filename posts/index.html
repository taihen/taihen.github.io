I keep sync of a set of personalized dotfiles between them – customized settings for programs that I’m using, like many of you. Till now, I was using my private git repository for things like my private scripts, <a href=http://www.mutt.org/ title="Mutt E-Mail Client">Mutt</a>, <a href=http://www.irssi.org/ title="Irssi IRC Client">Irssi</a>, <a href=http://ekg2.org/ title="Ekg2 Multichat Client">Ekg2</a> or <a href=http://tmux.sourceforge.net/ title="Tmux Terminal Multiplexer">Tmux</a> configurations. On the other hand some I keep publicly available for others i.e. on <a href=https://github.com/taihen title="GitHub Taihen">GitHub</a> like <a href=https://github.com/taihen/vimfiles>Vim configs</a>. And oh boy, there are so many of them! The true is, I customize almost everything that I’m using including simple tools like cp (just to get progress bar or interactivity).</p></div><a href=/posts/stow/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/ipv5/ class="link black dim">What ever happend to IPv5</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"><p>Back in 1994, a new Internet Protocol was in the works—<strong>Internet Protocol next generation (IPng)</strong>—which eventually became <strong>IPv6</strong>. The goal was to have it up and running by 1996, with the idea that by the time IPv4 addresses ran out, everyone would already be using IPv6. Well… that didn’t quite go as planned. As of last year, global adoption of IPv6 only just hit <strong>1%</strong>.</p><p>Interestingly, in the early days, IPng was actually labeled as <strong>version 7</strong>. But skipping version numbers—especially to an odd one—felt irrational, so it was quickly corrected to <strong>version 6</strong> around the 26th IETF meeting. IPv6 was meant to be the savior of the internet, replacing the well-worn and rapidly depleting IPv4. It did this mainly by expanding address space from <strong>32 bits to 128 bits</strong>, which seemed like an overwhelming amount at the time. IPv6 also introduced <strong>anycast routing</strong>, removed checksums from the IP layer, and made several other improvements.</p></div><a href=/posts/ipv5/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/leapsecond/ class="link black dim">CLOCK: INSERTING LEAP SECOND 23:59:60 UTC</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"><p>I found above message in a kernel log and I was just wondering what is all about.

Early versions of Unix stored time as a 32-bit integer counting 1/60-second intervals, a design influenced by the hardware clock frequency of the PDP-11 systems. This approach limited the maximum representable time span to approximately 829 days (~2.5 years), necessitating an epoch set in the recent past.</p></div><a href=/posts/1970/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div></div></section></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://taihen.org/>&copy; taihen.org / 418 ... engineering in progress 2025</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
