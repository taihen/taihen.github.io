On the other hand some I keep publicly available for others i.e. on <a href=https://github.com/taihen title="GitHub Taihen">GitHub</a> like <a href=https://github.com/taihen/vimfiles>Vim configs</a>. And oh boy, there are so many of them!

This is one of the reasons of non-compatibility between IPv4 and IPv6 as the idea was that by the time that we will exhaust IPv4 addresses everybody will be already on IPv6. Rightâ€¦ by know we see that global adoption just reached the mark of 1% last year. Interestingly enough IPng at the beginning was called a protocol version 7 but as it was irrational to skip numbers, especially to odd ones, it was quickly corrected around 26th IETF to version 6. IPv6 was supposed to be the life saver over the well-used and already depleting IPv4, basically by increasing the size from 32 bits to 128 bits. Additionally it introduced as well anycast routing, removed the checksum from the IP layer etc. though we still have version field, 8 bits that identify this IP header as being of version 4 when there is a 4 in there and presumably they would use a 5 to identify this next generation version. Unfortunately, 5 was already given to something else.</p></div><a href=/posts/ipv5/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div></div></article></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4"><article class="bb b--black-10"><div class="db pv4 ph3 ph0-l no-underline dark-gray"><div class="flex flex-column flex-row-ns"><div class="blah w-100"><h1 class="f3 fw1 athelas mt0 lh-title"><a href=/posts/leapsecond/ class="color-inherit dim link">CLOCK: INSERTING LEAP SECOND 23:59:60 UTC</a></h1><div class="f6 f5-l lh-copy nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p>I found above message in a kernel log and I was just wondering what is all about.

Early versions of Unix stored time as a 32-bit integer counting 1/60-second intervals, a design influenced by the hardware clock frequency of the PDP-11 systems. This approach limited the maximum representable time span to approximately 829 days (~2.5 years), necessitating an epoch set in the recent past.</p></div><a href=/posts/1970/ class="ba b--moon-gray bg-light-gray br2 color-inherit dib f7 hover-bg-moon-gray link mt2 ph2 pv1">read more</a></div></div></div></article></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4"><article class="bb b--black-10"><div class="db pv4 ph3 ph0-l no-underline dark-gray"><div class="flex flex-column flex-row-ns"><div class="blah w-100"><h1 class="f3 fw1 athelas mt0 lh-title"><a href=/posts/test-page/ class="color-inherit dim link">Test Page</a></h1><div class="f6 f5-l lh-copy nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p>Welcome to the most exciting test page you&rsquo;ll ever encounter! ðŸŽ‰</p><h3 id=why-is-this-page-here>Why is this page here?</h3><p>Well, everything has humble beginning.</p><h3 id=fun-facts>Fun Facts</h3><ul><li><strong>Did you know?</strong> The first website ever created is still online!
